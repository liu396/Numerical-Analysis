Some numerical practices for some interesting mathematical problems.

1."Newton.py" generates newton basin. Points starting from different quadrants will converge to a designated region, except those around the diagonals.

2."Happy_to_Sad.py" generates animations of a face that is initially happy, then goes to sad. Polynomial interpolation and spline interpolation are used. When control points are dense, polynomial interpolation will bring some problems. Click on the image to watch the animation.
